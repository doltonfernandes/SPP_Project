In-memory Key-Value Storage Software in C++

Supports insertion, retreival and removal both by key and lexicographic order. Multithreaded benchmark application can load data of about 10 million entries under a minute. A AVL tree was used as the primary data-structure for storing the KV pairs for enhanced performance.

This project was done as a part of the Software Programming for Performance course at IIIT Hyderabad.
